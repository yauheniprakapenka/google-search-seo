# Remove your AMP pages from Google Search

This page describes how web developers can remove their AMP pages from Google Search.

> **Key Point**: Throughout this page, we refer to canonical pages, AMP pages, and non-AMP pages. The canonical page can be either a non-AMP version of the page or it can be the AMP page itself. You may have one of two possible page setups:
>
> - **Canonical AMP**: One version of a page, where the AMP page is the canonical page.
> - **Canonical non-AMP**: Two versions of a page that includes an AMP page and a canonical non-AMP page.

There are three options for removing AMP content:

- [Quickly remove all versions of a page](#remove-all-versions-of-amp-content-including-amp-and-non-amp), including the AMP and canonical non-AMP pages
- [Remove only the AMP page](#remove-only-amp-pages-while-preserving-the-canonical-non-amp-pages) that is paired with a canonical non-AMP page, while keeping the canonical non-AMP page live
- [Remove AMP content with a CMS](#remove-amp-and-non-amp-pages-with-a-cms) (with options to remove all versions of a page, or only the AMP version)

## Remove all versions of AMP content, including AMP and non-AMP

This section describes how to remove all versions of AMP content from Google Search, which includes AMP and non-AMP pages.

> **Caution**: This method might display an error message to the user. Only use this method to remove your AMP page as quickly as possible from Google Search.

To remove AMP and non-AMP pages from Google Search, follow these steps:

1. Delete the AMP and non-AMP versions of the page from your server or CMS.
2. Use the [Remove outdated content](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals) tool to request the removal of your page. Enter the URLs (web addresses) to your AMP and non-AMP versions of the page that you want to remove.
3. [Update the Google AMP Cache](https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/update-cache) to ensure that your AMP content is removed from the cache.
4. Verify the removal of your AMP page by searching for your content using Google Search. To verify the removal of a large number of AMP pages, use the [AMP status report](https://search.google.com/search-console/amp) in Search Console. [Watch for a decreasing trendline on the "indexed AMP pages" graph.](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7450883)

You can check the status of your request on the [Remove outdated content](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals) page.

> **Note**: When you delete your AMP page, there's a delay before the Googlebot discovers it has been removed. Google Search displays an error to the user during this time.

## Remove only AMP pages, while preserving the canonical non-AMP pages

This section describes how to remove only AMP pages from Google Search, while still preserving your canonical non-AMP pages.

> **Caution**: Don't remove AMP content by simply deleting content in the file. Documents that are empty and missing all markup are considered invalid. When Google Search recognizes that a document is invalid, Google Search continues to serve the oldest valid version that's available.

To remove the AMP version of your page from Google Search (while preserving the canonical non-AMP page), follow these steps:

1. Remove the `rel="amphtml"` link from the canonical non-AMP page in the source code.
2. Configure your server to return either an `HTTP 301 Moved Permanently` or `302 Found` response for the removed AMP page.
3. Configure a redirect from the removed AMP page to the canonical non-AMP page.
4. If you want to remove an AMP page from non-Google platforms in addition to removing from Google Search, complete these steps:
    1. Remove your AMP page so that it is no longer accessible by configuring your server to send an `HTTP 404 Not Found` for your removed AMP page. This ensures that the Google AMP Cache doesn't serve stale content to other platforms.
    2. [Update the Google AMP Cache](https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/update-cache) to ensure that your AMP content is removed from the cache.
    3. Verify the removal of your AMP page by searching for your content in Google Search. To verify removal of a large number of AMP pages, use the [AMP status report](https://search.google.com/search-console/amp) in Search Console. [Watch for a decreasing trendline on the "indexed AMP pages" graph.](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7450883)
    4. If you want to keep permalinks active, configure your server to send an `HTTP 301 Redirect` for your removed AMP page to your canonical non-AMP page.

## Remove AMP and non-AMP pages with a CMS

Generally, CMS providers publish AMP and non-AMP pages at the same time. To remove a single page, unpublish or delete the page, which removes both the AMP and non-AMP versions of that page.

### Delete a single page

To delete a page and stop publishing it in both its AMP and non-AMP forms, use the CMS interface. Check your CMS provider's help page for details on how to stop serving AMP:

- [WordPress.com help](https://en.support.wordpress.com/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages/)
- [Drupal help](https://cgit.drupalcode.org/amp/tree/README.md?h=8.x-1.x)
- [SquareSpace help](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/223766868-Using-AMP-with-Squarespace)

### Remove all AMP pages

Another option is to disable AMP from your CMS.

> **Warning**: This option removes all AMP pages from your site.

To disable AMP, check your CMS provider's help page or contact your CMS provider. If your site is hosted on a CMS domain, the CMS can redirect users to the canonical non-AMP page after AMP is disabled. If the redirect doesn't occur, contact your CMS provider for assistance.
