After you've [created AMP content](/search/docs/guides/enhance-amp), here are some ways to validate your AMP content:

- Use the [AMP Test Tool](https://search.google.com/test/amp) to ensure that your AMP content is valid.
- For [applicable AMP content types](/search/docs/guides/about-amp), use the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to verify that your structured data parses properly.
- Use the [AMP status report](https://search.google.com/search-console/amp) to monitor the performance of all AMP pages on your site.

## Fix common AMP errors

If your AMP page doesn't appear in Google Search, try the following steps:

**Note**: It can take time for Google to index your AMP content.

1. [Make your page discoverable](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/discovery) by linking your pages.
    - Did you add `rel="amphtml"` to the canonical page?
    - Did you add `rel="amphtml"` to other non-AMP pages (for example, mobile)?
    - Did you add `rel="canonical"` to the AMP page?
2. Follow the [Google Search guidelines for AMP pages](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/amp).
3. Make your AMP content accessible to Googlebot:
    - Edit your site's robots.txt to allow Googlebot to crawl the canonical page, AMP page, and links in the structured data (if applicable).
    - Remove all robots `meta` tags and `X-Robots-Tag` HTTP headers from your canonical and AMP content. For more information, see [Robots `meta` tag and `X-Robots-Tag` HTTP header specifications](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag).
4. Ensure that your structured data follows the structured data guidelines for [your page and feature type](/search/docs/guides/search-gallery). For more information about structured data requirements for AMP, see [About AMP on Google Search](/search/docs/guides/about-amp).

If your AMP page still isn't appearing in Google Search after completing the steps, here are some additional reasons:

- Certain Google Search features might not be available in your country.
- Your site might not be indexed yet. For more information about crawling and indexing, see the [Crawling and indexing FAQ](/search/help/crawling-index-faq).
