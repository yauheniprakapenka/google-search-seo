You can enhance your [AMP](/amp) content for Google Search by creating a basic AMP page, adding structured data, monitoring your pages, and practicing with codelabs.

## Create a basic AMP page

1. [Create your first AMP page](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/create).
2. Follow the [Google Search guidelines for AMP pages](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/amp).
3. Make your content [discoverable by linking your pages](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/discovery). For crawling and indexing, Google Search requires that an AMP page links to a [canonical page](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls). The canonical page can be either a non-AMP version of the page or it can be the AMP page itself. For more information, see the [What's in an AMP URL?](https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/02/whats-in-amp-url.html) developer blog post.
4. Ensure that users can experience the same content and complete the same actions on AMP pages as on the corresponding canonical pages, where possible.
5. Use the [AMP Test Tool](https://search.google.com/test/amp) to ensure that your page meets the Google Search requirements for a valid AMP HTML document.
6. Use the same [structured data markup](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data) across both the canonical and AMP pages.
7. Apply common content best practices:
   1. Make sure that your [robots.txt file](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/robots_txt) doesn't block your AMP page. Use [robots `meta` tags, `data-nosnippet`, and `X-Robots-Tag`](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag) where appropriate.
   2. Follow the guidelines for [hreflang for language and regional URLs](/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions). For AMP specific examples, see [Internationalization](https://amp.dev/documentation/examples/guides/internationalization/).

## Create an AMP page using a CMS

If you serve your web content through a Content Management System (CMS), you can use an existing CMS plugin (such as for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/amp), or Joomla) or implement custom functionality in your CMS to generate AMP content. If you intend to customize your CMS, follow these guidelines in addition to [Create a basic AMP page](#create-basic-amp):

- Consider how AMP HTML files will fit your site's URL path scheme. If you're generating an AMP page in addition to a canonical non-AMP page, we recommend choosing one of the following URL schemes:
  - `https://www.example.com/myarticle/amp`
  - `https://www.example.com/myarticle.amp.html`
- Develop a structured data markup template. Here are some guidelines:
  - Construct the template based on the requirements for the type of content you are publishing.
  - Refer to [AMP Project metadata examples](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/main/examples/metadata-examples) for sample templates for recipes, articles, videos, and reviews.

## Optimize for rich results

You can use structured data to enhance the appearance of your page in search results. AMP pages with structured data can appear as a [rich result](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery), like the Top stories carousel or host carousel.

1. [Implement structured data](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data).
2. Verify that your structured data parses correctly by using the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).
3. Verify your complete AMP for Google Search by using the [AMP Test Tool](https://search.google.com/test/amp).

## Monitor and improve your pages

Periodically check all of your AMP pages by monitoring the following reports:

- [AMP status report](https://search.google.com/search-console/amp): Catch site templating and other site-wide implementation issues that can affect large numbers of your AMP pages.
- [Rich result status reports](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7552505): Identify problems with your structured data and opportunities to provide additional structured data.

If you need to immediately update the Google AMP Cache to serve the latest version of your content, refer to [Update AMP Content](/amp/cache/update-ping).

If you need to stop serving your AMP pages from Google Search results, follow [Remove AMP from Google Search results](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/amp/remove-amp).

## Practice with codelabs

Here are some codelabs to practice building AMP pages for Google Search:

- Learn how to build AMP pages with the [AMP foundations codelab.](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/accelerated-mobile-pages-foundations/)
- Add features like analytics, video embedding, social media integration, and image carousels to your AMP pages with the [Advanced concepts codelab.](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/accelerated-mobile-pages-advanced/#0)
- Build a [beautiful, interactive, and canonical AMP pages codelab](/codelabs/amp-beautiful-interactive-canonical#0) that incorporates many AMP features and extended components.
- Use AMP components to build a [PWA](/web/progressive-web-apps) experience with the [AMP+PWA codelab](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/integrate/integrate-with-apps/).
