Many users prefer not to have explicit content shown in their search results, and Google has systems in place to help users filter explicit content. If your site hosts explicit or adult content, you can help Google understand the nature of your site and content, which can help Google to more accurately categorize your site and ensure user preference regarding explicit content.

**Is your site being incorrectly flagged as explicit?** Check our [troubleshooting guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/explicit/troubleshooting) for more on how to confirm if your site has been incorrectly categorized and how to fix the issue.

## How Google handles explicit content in Search results

Google uses multiple systems to protect users from being exposed to unexpected explicit results. Our algorithms detect user intention and rank results accordingly, weighing result quality and the relevance of explicit results to user queries. With SafeSearch, we help users to filter out explicit content.

### How SafeSearch works

SafeSearch is designed to filter results that lead to visual depictions of:

- Explicit sexual content of any type, including pornography
- Nudity
- Photo-realistic sex toys
- Sex-oriented dating or escort services
- Violence or gore
- Links to pages containing explicit content

For example, SafeSearch is designed to filter out pages that contain images or videos that contain exposed breasts or genitals, as well as to filter pages with links, pop-ups, or ads that display or point to explicit content. It also aims to allow explicit content when it has an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA) value. SafeSearch relies on automated systems that use machine learning and a variety of signals to identify explicit content, including text, images, and videos on the hosting web page and in links.

Even when SafeSearch is off or set to blur, Google's ranking and language understanding systems work to prevent unwanted exposure to sexually explicit and graphic violent content. Using query understanding algorithms, Google Search is designed to detect whether searches are seeking out explicit content, helping reduce the chances of encountering unwanted explicit search results.

Regardless of your SafeSearch setting, Google removes pages that violate our [content policies](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10622781) (such as child sexual abuse material). We also remove pages upon user request for [personal information removal](https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061) (for example content involving [explicit personal imagery created or shared without consent](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6302812), or [explicit non-consensual fake content](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9116649)).

### How Google handles sites with a significant amount of removals of violative sexually explicit content

If we process a significant volume of valid removal requests involving a particular site, we use that as a signal to improve our results. In particular, regarding sexually explicit content:

- **CSAM removals**: We always remove child sexual abuse material (CSAM) when it's identified, either automatically or through the legal removals process. We also demote all content from sites with a significant proportion of CSAM content.
- **Explicit personal information removals**: We demote all pages from sites that receive a significant volume of personal removals of content involving [explicit personal imagery created or shared without consent](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6302812) or [explicit non-consensual fake content](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9116649).

## Best practices

By following these best practices, you not only help ensure that users see the results they expect and foster a safer online environment for everyone, but also help ensure your target audience can find your content through Google Search.

1. [Prevent user-generated harmful content on your platform](#prevent-user-generated-harmful-content).
2. [Allow Google to fetch your video content files](#allow-google-to-fetch).
3. [Allow Googlebot to crawl without age gate](#allow-googlebot-to-crawl).
4. [Group explicit pages in a separate domain or subdomain](#group-explicit-pages).
5. [Mark specific pages as explicit with metadata](#mark-specific-pages).

### Prevent user-generated harmful content on your platform

To foster a safer online environment for users, we recommend that platforms featuring sexually explicit content implement publisher verification and content moderation processes. Adopting these measures is a best practice that helps manage content responsibly and mitigate risks associated with potentially harmful or illegal material, such as CSAM and non-consensual explicit content.

#### Implementing proactive CSAM detection in user-generated content

To prevent the distribution of child sexual abuse material, we recommend that platforms use industry-standard techniques such as hash matching for detecting known violative content and classifiers for detecting novel content. By proactively identifying and flagging potentially violative content, you can significantly enhance the safety of your platforms and contribute to the broader effort of combating child exploitation.

### Allow Google to fetch your video content files

Allowing Googlebot to [fetch your video files](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video#allow-fetch) enables Google to understand the video content and reduces the chance of exposing users to violative explicit content, such as CSAM and non-consensual explicit content.

If you don't allow Google to fetch your video content files, Google can't run automated protections against [egregious violations such as CSAM](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10622781#zippy=%2Cchild-sexual-abuse-imagery-or-exploitation-material). Content that can't be fetched may pose a risk to our users, so Google may demote or filter such pages where the embedded video content is unavailable and our automated systems determine that the page may contain explicit content. Not allowing Googlebot to fetch your video files may significantly affect the ranking of your explicit pages on Google Search, and especially in Video mode.

If you're concerned about exposing your video file too broadly, you can also verify if Googlebot requests to your server [really are from Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/verifying-googlebot).

### Allow Googlebot to crawl without age gate

If you have content behind an age gate or other access restriction, be sure to allow Googlebot to crawl your content without triggering the age gate. You can do this by [verifying Googlebot requests](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/verifying-googlebot) and serving the content without age gate.

If you don't allow Googlebot to crawl without triggering the age gate, it may cause your site to rank poorly on Google Search. Google might not be able to fetch your content, including image or video bytes, and therefore not be able to effectively rank that page for relevant queries. Additionally, if you host some non-explicit content behind age-gate and Googlebot cannot see it, there is a higher chance that this content or even the whole site gets classified automatically as explicit, which will make it ineligible to appear when the SafeSearch filter is on.

### Group explicit pages in a separate domain or subdomain

If your site contains significant amounts of explicit content and non-explicit content, we recommend grouping the explicit pages on a separate domain or subdomain. For example, you could host your explicit pages on `https://explicit.example.com/...`, and your non-explicit pages on `https://www.example.com/...`.

If you don't group pages separately, our systems might determine that your entire site seems explicit in nature and filter the entire site when the SafeSearch filter is on, even if some pages might not be explicit.

It's not necessary to use the word "explicit" in the domain. It only matters that the pages are grouped together on another domain or subdomain that's separate from your non-explicit pages.

### Mark specific pages as explicit with metadata

Google has algorithms to automatically detect explicit pages, including text, images, and videos. While not necessary, adding metadata can be a practical way for you to tag a few explicit pages on your site or if you want to be sure that a particular page is filtered for SafeSearch users:

- [Add metadata to pages with explicit content](#add-metadata).
- [Use the `<video:family_friendly>` tag in your video sitemap](#use-video-family-friendly-tag).

#### Add metadata to pages with sexually explicit content

To mark a particular page as explicit, add [rating markup](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/special-tags#rating) with the `adult` value either as a [`meta` tag](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/special-tags#rating) or an HTTP response header. We recommend adding this tag to any page with sexually explicit content.

```html
<meta name="rating" content="adult">
```

Google also recognizes `<meta name="rating" content="RTA-5042-1996-1400-1577-RTA">` as an equivalent way to identify pages with sexually explicit content. Either tag is fine; it's not required to add both tags.

If you use a CMS, such as Wix, WordPress, or Blogger, you might not be able to edit your HTML directly, or you might prefer not to. Instead, your CMS might have a search engine settings page or some other mechanism to tell search engines about `meta` tags. If you want to add a `meta` tag to your website, search for instructions about modifying the `<head>` of your page on your CMS (for example, search for "wix add meta tags").

#### Use the `<video:family_friendly>` tag in your video sitemap

If you have a range of videos on your site, including content appropriate for all ages as well as sexually explicit or content that contains graphic violence, make use of the [`<video:family_friendly>` tag in your video sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/video-sitemaps#family-friendly). You only need to use this tag (set to `no`) for videos that are explicit. This helps Google understand which videos on your site shouldn't appear when SafeSearch filtering is enabled.
