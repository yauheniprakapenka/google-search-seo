A review snippet is a short excerpt of a review or a rating from a review website, usually an average of the combined rating scores from many reviewers. When Google finds valid reviews or ratings markup, we may show a rich snippet that includes stars and other summary info from reviews or ratings. In addition to the text of the review, a rating is an evaluation described on a numeric scale (such as 1 to 5). Review snippets may appear in rich results or Google Knowledge Panels. You can supply ratings for the following features:

**Note**: The actual appearance in search results might be different. You can preview most features with the [Rich Results Test](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7445569).

-   [Book](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/book)
-   [Course list](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/course)
-   [Event](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/event)
-   [Local business](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/local-business) (only for sites that capture reviews about other local businesses; see the [guidelines about self-serving reviews](#self-serving))
-   [Movie](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/movie)
-   [Product](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product)
-   [Recipe](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe)
-   [Software App](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/software-app)

Google also supports reviews for the following schema.org types (and their subtypes):

-   `[CreativeWorkSeason](https://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeason)`
-   `[CreativeWorkSeries](https://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeries)`
-   `[Episode](https://schema.org/Episode)`
-   `[Game](https://schema.org/Game)`
-   `[MediaObject](https://schema.org/MediaObject)`
-   `[MusicPlaylist](https://schema.org/MusicPlaylist)`
-   `[MusicRecording](https://schema.org/MusicRecording)`
-   `[Organization](https://schema.org/Organization)` (only for sites that capture reviews about other organizations; see the [guidelines about self-serving reviews](#self-serving))

**Does your site provide reviews about other employers?** Use [`EmployerAggregateRating` structured data](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/employer-rating).

## How to add structured data

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about [how structured data works](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data).

Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data.

1.  Add the [required properties](#structured-data-type-definitions). Based on the format you're using, learn where to [insert structured data on the page](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data#format-placement).
    
    **Using a CMS?** It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.  
    **Using JavaScript?** Learn how to [generate structured data with JavaScript](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/generate-structured-data-with-javascript).
    
2.  Follow the [guidelines](#guidelines).
3.  Validate your code using the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).
4.  Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the `noindex` tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can [ask Google to recrawl your URLs](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/ask-google-to-recrawl).
    
    **Note**: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
    
5.  To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you [submit a sitemap](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap). You can automate this with the [Search Console Sitemap API](/webmaster-tools/v1/sitemaps).

## Examples

There are several ways you can add `Review` structured data to a page:

-   Add a simple review.
-   Nest a review into another schema.org type using its [`review`](https://schema.org/review) property.
-   Add aggregate ratings. You can omit the rating for an individual review if your marked-up content contains both an author and a review date. For aggregate reviews, you must supply the average rating for the rich snippet to display.
-   Nest aggregate ratings into another schema.org type using its [`aggregateRating`](https://schema.org/aggregateRating) property.

## Guidelines

Your content must follow these guidelines to be eligible to appear as a rich result.

**Warning:** If your site violates one or more of these guidelines, then Google may take [manual action](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2604824) against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for [reconsideration](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35843).

-   [Technical guidelines](#technical-guidelines)
-   [Search Essentials](/search/docs/essentials)
-   [General structured data guidelines](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/sd-policies)

### Technical guidelines

-   Make sure to mark up an aggregate evaluation of an item by many people with [schema.org/AggregateRating](https://schema.org/AggregateRating). Google may display aggregate ratings as rich snippets or, for certain types of items, answers in search results.
-   Refer clearly to a specific product or service by nesting the review within the markup of another schema.org type, such as [schema.org/Book](https://schema.org/Book) or [schema.org/Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe), or by using a schema.org type as a value for the `itemReviewed` property.
-   Make sure the review content you mark up are readily available to users from the marked-up page. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has review content. For example, if you marked up reviews, users should be able to see the text of the review and associated rating. If you use `AggregateRating`, users should be able to see that aggregate rating on the page.
-   We recommend only accepting ratings that are accompanied by a review comment and author's name. While not required, this approach can help your users see supporting details that explain the rating.
-   Provide review information about a specific item, not about a category or a list of items.
-   If you include multiple individual reviews, also include an aggregate rating of the individual reviews.
-   Don't aggregate reviews or ratings from other websites.
-   If the review snippet is for a local business or an organization, you must follow these additional guidelines:
    -   If the entity that's being reviewed controls the reviews about itself, their pages that use `LocalBusiness` or any other type of `Organization` structured data are ineligible for star review feature. For example, a review about entity A is placed on the website of entity A, either directly in their structured data or through an embedded third-party widget (for example, Google Business reviews or Facebook reviews widget).
        
        For more information, check out our [blog post on why we added this guideline](/search/blog/2019/09/making-review-rich-results-more-helpful#updated) and our [FAQ about the change](/search/blog/2019/09/making-review-rich-results-more-helpful#faq).
        
    -   Ratings must be sourced directly from users.
    -   Don't rely on human editors to create, curate, or compile ratings information for local businesses.

## Structured data type definitions

You must include the required properties for your structured data to display in search results. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information to your structured data, which could provide a better user experience.

### `Review`

The full definition of `Review` is available at [schema.org/Review](https://schema.org/Review).

The Google-supported properties are the following:

Required properties

`author`

`[Person](https://schema.org/Person)` or `[Organization](https://schema.org/Organization)`

The author of the review. The reviewer's name must be a valid name. For example, "50% off until Saturday" is not a valid name for a reviewer.

This field must be shorter than 100 characters. If it's longer than 100 characters, your page won't be eligible for an author-based review snippet.

To help Google best understand authors across various features, consider following the [author markup best practices](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/article#author-bp).

`itemReviewed` (if review is not a [Nested Review](#embedded-review-example))

One of the valid types

The item that is being reviewed. However, if the review is nested into another schema.org type using the `[review](https://schema.org/review)` property, omit the `itemReviewed` property (we assume the parent item is the reviewed item).

The valid types for the reviewed item are:

-   `[Book](https://schema.org/Book)`
-   `[Course](https://schema.org/Course)`
-   `[CreativeWorkSeason](https://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeason)`
-   `[CreativeWorkSeries](https://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeries)`
-   `[Episode](https://schema.org/Episode)`
-   `[Event](https://schema.org/Event)`
-   `[Game](https://schema.org/Game)`
-   `[HowTo](https://schema.org/HowTo)`
-   `[LocalBusiness](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness)`
-   `[MediaObject](https://schema.org/MediaObject)`
-   `[Movie](https://schema.org/Movie)`
-   `[MusicPlaylist](https://schema.org/MusicPlaylist)`
-   `[MusicRecording](https://schema.org/MusicRecording)`
-   `[Organization](https://schema.org/Organization)`
-   `[Product](https://schema.org/Product)`
-   `[Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe)`
-   `[SoftwareApplication](https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication)`

`itemReviewed.name` or parent item `name` in [Nested Review](#embedded-review-example)

`[Text](https://schema.org/Text)`

The name of the item that is being reviewed. If the review is nested into another schema.org type using the `[review](https://schema.org/review)` property, you still need to provide the `name` of the thing that is being reviewed. For example:

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Game",
  **"name": "Firefly",**
  "review": {
    "@type": "Review",
    "reviewRating": {
      "@type": "Rating",
      "ratingValue": 5
    },
    "author": {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }
}

`reviewRating`

`[Rating](https://schema.org/Rating)`

The rating given in this review. The rating can be a nested [`Rating`](https://schema.org/Rating) or more specific subtype. The most typical subtype is [`AggregateRating`](#aggregated-rating-type-definition).

`reviewRating.ratingValue`

`[Number](https://schema.org/Number)` or `[Text](https://schema.org/Text)`

A numerical quality rating for the item, either a number, fraction, or percentage (for example, `4`, `60%`, or `6 / 10`). Google understands the scale for fractions and percentages, since the scale is implied in the fraction itself or the percentage. The default scale for numbers is a 5-point scale, where 1 is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value. If another scale is intended, use `bestRating` and `worstRating`.

For decimal numbers, use a dot instead of a comma to specify the value (for example `4.4` instead of `4,4`). In Microdata and RDFa, you can use `content` attributes to override the visible content. That way, you can show the user whatever style convention you want, while also satisfying the dot requirement for structured data. For example:

<span itemprop="ratingValue" content="4.4">4,4</span> stars

Recommended properties

`datePublished`

`[Date](https://schema.org/Date)`

The date that the review was published, in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format.

`reviewRating.bestRating`

`[Number](https://schema.org/Number)`

The highest value allowed in this rating system. If `bestRating` is omitted, 5 is assumed.

`reviewRating.worstRating`

`[Number](https://schema.org/Number)`

The lowest value allowed in this rating system. If `worstRating` is omitted, 1 is assumed.

### `AggregateRating`

The full definition of `AggregateRating` is available at [schema.org/AggregateRating](https://schema.org/AggregateRating).

The Google-supported properties are the following:

Required properties

`itemReviewed` (if aggregate rating is not a [Nested Aggregate Rating](#embedded-aggregate-rating))

One of the valid types

The item that is being rated. However, if the aggregate rating is nested into another schema.org type using the `[aggregateRating](https://schema.org/aggregateRating)` property, omit the `itemReviewed` property.

The valid types for the reviewed item are:

-   `[Book](https://schema.org/Book)`
-   `[Course](https://schema.org/Course)`
-   `[CreativeWorkSeason](https://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeason)`
-   `[CreativeWorkSeries](https://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeries)`
-   `[Episode](https://schema.org/Episode)`
-   `[Event](https://schema.org/Event)`
-   `[Game](https://schema.org/Game)`
-   `[HowTo](https://schema.org/HowTo)`
-   `[LocalBusiness](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness)`
-   `[MediaObject](https://schema.org/MediaObject)`
-   `[Movie](https://schema.org/Movie)`
-   `[MusicPlaylist](https://schema.org/MusicPlaylist)`
-   `[MusicRecording](https://schema.org/MusicRecording)`
-   `[Organization](https://schema.org/Organization)`
-   `[Product](https://schema.org/Product)`
-   `[Recipe](https://schema.org/Recipe)`
-   `[SoftwareApplication](https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication)`

`itemReviewed.name` or parent item `name` in [Nested Aggregate Rating](#embedded-aggregate-rating)

`[Text](https://schema.org/Text)`

The name of the item that is being reviewed. If the review is nested into another schema.org type using the `[aggregateRating](https://schema.org/aggregateRating)` property, you still need to provide the `name` of the thing that is being reviewed. For example:

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Game",
  **"name": "Firefly",**
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": 88,
    "bestRating": 100,
    "ratingCount": 20
  }
}

`ratingCount`

`[Number](https://schema.org/Number)`

The total number of ratings for the item on your site. At least one of `ratingCount` or `reviewCount` is required.

`reviewCount`

`[Number](https://schema.org/Number)`

Specifies the number of people who provided a review with or without an accompanying rating. At least one of `ratingCount` or `reviewCount` is required.

`ratingValue`

`[Number](https://schema.org/Number)` or `[Text](https://schema.org/Text)`

The average rating for the item's quality using a numerical rating of either a number, fraction, or percentage (for example, `4`, `60%`, or `6 / 10`). Google understands the scale for fractions and percentages, since the scale is implied in the fraction itself or the percentage. The default scale for numbers is a 5-point scale, where 1 is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value. If another scale is intended, use `bestRating` and `worstRating`.

For decimal numbers, use a dot instead of a comma to specify the value (for example `4.4` instead of `4,4`). In Microdata and RDFa, you can use `content` attributes to override the visible content. That way, you can show the user whatever style convention you want, while also satisfying the dot requirement for structured data. For example:

<span itemprop="ratingValue" content="4.4">4,4</span> stars

Recommended properties

`bestRating`

`[Number](https://schema.org/Number)`

The highest value allowed in this rating system. If `bestRating` is omitted, 5 is assumed.

`worstRating`

`[Number](https://schema.org/Number)`

The lowest value allowed in this rating system. If `worstRating` is omitted, 1 is assumed.

## Monitor rich results with Search Console

Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search. You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results, but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:

1.  [After deploying structured data for the first time](#after-deploying)
2.  [After releasing new templates or updating your code](#after-releasing)
3.  [Analyzing traffic periodically](#analyzing-periodically)

### After deploying structured data for the first time

After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant [Rich result status report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7552505). Ideally, there will be an increase of valid items, and no increase in invalid items. If you find issues in your structured data:

1.  [Fix the invalid items](#troubleshooting).
2.  [Inspect a live URL](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289#test_live_page) to check if the issue persists.
3.  [Request validation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/13300208) using the status report.

### After releasing new templates or updating your code

When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data invalid items.

-   If you see an **increase in invalid items**, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing template in a new and bad way.
-   If you see a **decrease in valid items** (not matched by an increase in invalid items), perhaps you are no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) to learn what is causing the issue.

### Analyzing traffic periodically

Analyze your Google Search traffic using the [Performance Report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7576553). The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these results with the [Search Console API](/webmaster-tools/search-console-api-original/v3/how-tos/search_analytics).

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that may help you.

-   If you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site, ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.
-   Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the [General Structured Data Guidelines](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/sd-policies).
-   You might have an error in your structured data. Check the [list of structured data errors](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/13300873) and the [Unparsable structured data report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9166415).
-   If you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix [structured data issues](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175#zippy=%2Cstructured-data-issue), use the [Manual Actions report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175).
-   Review the [guidelines](#guidelines) again to identify if your content isn't compliant with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage. However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to identify these issues.

-   Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it. For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the [Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ](/search/help/crawling-index-faq).
-   Post a question in the [Google Search Central forum](https://support.google.com/webmasters/community).
