Many merchants have loyalty programs that offer members special benefits, such as special prices and loyalty points. When you add `MemberProgram` structured data to your site, Google Search can use this information to display loyalty benefits with your products and knowledge panels in Search results.

The loyalty programs that you offer for your business can be specified using the `MemberProgram` structured data type nested under the `Organization` structured data type. To specify the loyalty benefits (such as loyalty prices and points earned) for your individual products, separately add `UnitPriceSpecification` markup under your `Offer` structured data markup as described under [merchant listings](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/merchant-listing#unit-price-specification-properties).

## Feature availability

Loyalty program information is available in Google Search results in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, the UK, and the US, on both desktop and mobile.

## How to add structured data

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about [how structured data works](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data).

Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data.

1.  Add the [required properties](#structured-data-type-definitions). Based on the format you're using, learn where to [insert structured data on the page](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data#format-placement).
    
    **Using a CMS?** It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.  
    **Using JavaScript?** Learn how to [generate structured data with JavaScript](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/generate-structured-data-with-javascript).
    
2.  Follow the [guidelines](#guidelines).
3.  Validate your code using the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).
4.  Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the `noindex` tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can [ask Google to recrawl your URLs](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/ask-google-to-recrawl).
    
    **Note**: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
    
5.  To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you [submit a sitemap](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap). You can automate this with the [Search Console Sitemap API](/webmaster-tools/v1/sitemaps).

## Examples

Here's an example of a `MemberProgram` structured data markup for a loyalty program with two membership tiers.

## Guidelines

For your loyalty program markup to be eligible for usage in Google Search, you must follow these guidelines:

-   [General structured data guidelines](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/sd-policies)
-   [Search Essentials](/search/docs/essentials)
-   [Technical guidelines](#technical-guidelines)

### Technical guidelines

-   Nest the `MemberProgram` markup under the `Organization` type on the page where you specify the administrative details and policies of your business. Refer to the [Organization markup](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/organization) documentation for more information.
-   To specify the loyalty benefits (such as loyalty prices and points earned) for your individual products, add the `UnitPriceSpecification` markup defined for [merchant listings](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/merchant-listing#unit-price-specification-properties). The `MemberProgram` markup you define for your business works together with `validForMemberTier` and `MembershipPointsEarned` structured data to define the loyalty benefits for your customers when buying your products.

## Structured data type definitions

You must include the required properties for your structured data to be eligible for usage in Google Search. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information about your loyalty programs, which could provide a better user experience.

### `MemberProgram`

Use the following properties to describe one or more loyalty programs and one or more tiers per loyalty program for your business.The full definition of `MemberProgram` is available at [schema.org/MemberProgram](https://schema.org/MemberProgram).

Required properties

`hasTiers`

-   `https://schema.org/TierBenefitLoyaltyPrice`: The benefit is a member's only price.

`name`

`[Text](https://schema.org/Text)`

The requirement to join a member tier. If not specified, anyone can join the tier for free. For a non-free tier, specify a value of the type representing the requirement to join the tier.

-   `https://schema.org/CreditCard`: Specify the credit card that the user needs to sign up for to join the tier. For example:
    
      "hasTierRequirement": {

        "name": "Capital Two cashback rewards platinum card"
      }
-   `https://schema.org/MonetaryAmount`: Specify the minimum amount of spending required to join the tier. For example, for a $250 minimum spending, specify:

        "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
        "value": 250,
        "currency": "USD"
      }
-   `https://schema.org/UnitPriceSpecification`: Specify the periodic fee a consumer needs to pay for membership in the tier. For example, for a 12 month membership, billed once a month at 9.99€, specify:

        "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",
        "price": 9.99,

`url`

`[URL](https://schema.org/URL)`

A URL of the web page where a shopper can sign up for this specific member tier. Don't provide multiple URLs.

## Using Merchant Center to configure loyalty programs with Google

Loyalty programs can be difficult to configure and keep up-to-date with markup. If you have a Google Merchant Center account, you can alternatively consider configuring your loyalty program directly in Google Merchant Center instead of using markup. Refer to the [Merchant help center article about loyalty program](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12827255) for more information.

If you provide both markup and Merchant Center loyalty programs, Google will use the Merchant Center settings.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that may help you.

-   If you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site, ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.
-   Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the [General Structured Data Guidelines](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/sd-policies).
-   You might have an error in your structured data. Check the [list of structured data errors](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/13300873) and the [Unparsable structured data report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9166415).
-   If you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix [structured data issues](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175#zippy=%2Cstructured-data-issue), use the [Manual Actions report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175).
-   Review the [guidelines](#guidelines) again to identify if your content isn't compliant with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage. However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to identify these issues.
-   [Troubleshoot missing rich results / drop in total rich results](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/13300208).
-   Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it. For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the [Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ](/search/help/crawling-index-faq).
-   Post a question in the [Google Search Central forum](https://support.google.com/webmasters/community).
