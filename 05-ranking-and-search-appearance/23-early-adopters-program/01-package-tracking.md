The package tracking early adopters program is no longer accepting new partners.

Package tracking is a feature that displays package tracking related information on Google. When people come to Search looking to track a package shipped with your company, they'll be able to enter a package ID directly. The feature uses your API to retrieve the package tracking information and then displays it to the user. Here's how package tracking information may appear on Google Search when a user seeks to track a package.

**Note**: The actual appearance in search results might be different.

## Feature availability

Package tracking is available in all languages and countries where Google Search is available. The program is no longer accepting new partners.

### Availability and responsiveness

We expect almost no downtime from your API and require that your API respond within 700ms on average with the 95th percentile not exceeding 1,000ms. If your API doesn't meet these requirements, we may stop displaying your package tracking information.

### Content

For the integration to work, your API must return the following information:
