Google Search supports [several search operators](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433) that you can use to refine or target your searches. The following search operators may also be useful for debugging your website.

For example, the `site:` search operator may be useful to monitor comment spam on your website, and the image search `imagesize:` operator may be helpful to find images on your site that are small.

Because search operators are bound by indexing and retrieval limits, the [URL Inspection](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289) tool in Search Console is more reliable for debugging purposes.

The following table contains the search operators that you can use to inspect different aspects of your pages in Search:

## Search operators

### `filetype:`

Find search results in a [specific file type](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/indexable-file-types) as defined by the `content-type` HTTP header, or file extension. For example, you can search for RTF files and URLs ending in `.rtf` whose content contains the term "galway":

```
filetype:rtf galway
```

### `imagesize:`

Find pages that contain images of a specific dimension. This search operator only works on Google Images. For example:

```
imagesize:1200x800
```

### `site:`

Find search results from a particular domain, URL, or URL prefix. For example:

```
site:https://www.google.com/
```

### `src:`

Find pages that reference a particular image URL in the `src` attribute. This search operator only works on Google Images. For example:

```
src:https://www.example.com/images/peanut-butter.png
```
